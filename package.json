    "description": "<p>Here's how you set up to query an Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone from your network:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Connect your network to a VPC using AWS Direct Connect or a VPN.</p> </li> <li> <p>Run the following AWS CLI command to create a Resolver endpoint:</p> <p> <code>create-resolver-endpoint --name [endpoint_name] --direction INBOUND --creator-request-id [unique_string] --security-group-ids [security_group_with_inbound_rules] --ip-addresses SubnetId=[subnet_id] SubnetId=[subnet_id_in_different_AZ]</code> </p> <p>Note the resolver endpoint ID that appears in the response. You'll use it in step 3.</p> </li> <li> <p>Get the IP addresses for the Resolver endpoints:</p> <p> <code>get-resolver-endpoint --resolver-endpoint-id [resolver_endpoint_id]</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>In your network configuration, define the IP addresses that you got in step 3 as DNS servers.</p> <p>You can now query instance names in your VPCs and the names of records in your private hosted zone.</p> </li> </ol> <p>You can also perform the following operations using the AWS CLI:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>list-resolver-endpoints</code>: List all endpoints. The syntax includes options for pagination and filtering.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>update-resolver-endpoints</code>: Add IP addresses to an endpoint or remove IP addresses from an endpoint. </p> </li> </ul> <p>To delete an endpoint, use the following AWS CLI command:</p> <p> <code>delete-resolver-endpoint --resolver-endpoint-id [resolver_endpoint_id]</code> </p>",
