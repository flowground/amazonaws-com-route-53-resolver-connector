You'll use it in step 3.</p> </li> <li> <p>Get the IP addresses for the Resolver endpoints:</p> <p> <code>get-resolver-endpoint --resolver-endpoint-id [resolver_endpoint_id]</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>In your network configuration, define the IP addresses that you got in step 3 as DNS servers.</p> <p>You can now query instance names in your VPCs and the names of records in your private hosted zone.</p> </li> </ol> <p>You can also perform the following operations using the AWS CLI:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>list-resolver-endpoints</code>: List all endpoints. The syntax includes options for pagination and filtering.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>update-resolver-endpoints</code>: Add IP addresses to an endpoint or remove IP addresses from an endpoint. </p> </li> </ul> <p>To delete an endpoint, use the following AWS CLI command:</p> <p> <code>delete-resolver-endpoint --resolver-endpoint-id [resolver_endpoint_id]</code> </p>",
